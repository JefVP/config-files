# My configs
Most of these config files are where they would normally be placed relative to the home folder.

For the fonts just do **sudo mv ./nerdFonts /usr/share/fonts/** followed by **sudo fc-cache**


# Dependencies
The package names are based on Arch Linux's pacman package manager, you might need to look into what your package manager calls these.
Keep in mind I might have missed something, maybe even something obvious, if something doesn't work check the config file.

## zsh
zsh-syntax-highlighting
zsh-autosuggestions

## picom
Not really a dependency, but my picom config uses OpenGL.
