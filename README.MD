# My configs
I have separated my configs for Arch / Gentoo in folders here so I don't need to maintain 2 seperate repositories for them.

## Arch
Most of my configs are usable without any real modifications, my neofetch config in its current state will likely get some information wrong though.

## Gentoo
It is a work in progress, I love the customisability of Gentoo, although I must add that it is most definitely time consuming.
Some configs are similar to my Arch configs and some of them are a bit different.
